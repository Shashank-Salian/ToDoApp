# rn-ToDo-App
A simple To-Do app for for beginners in React Native.

This code is a part of my YouTube Video Tutorial of React Native. You can watch that here [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoJoCcJUQHA&list=PLzeFySG2u5gfliut6U92Bj13TmFkj0ceD&index=1&t=2s)
In this app you will learn and use many components offered by React-Native and style, add some event listners to those components.

You will also learn to save all the input entered by the user in the users device by using `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` library.
